Introduction

The primary focus of ODIS-SD is to enhance the precision of steganalysis in the detection of digital images containing sensitive information. The effectiveness of ODIS-SD is assessed using the BOSSBase version 1.01 dataset alongside two adaptive steganography algorithms (WOW and S-UNIWARD) with payload sizes of 0.2 and 0.4 bits per pixel (bpp). The outcomes reveal a significant enhancement in detection accuracy ranging from 2.1% to 3.6% in comparison to prior research endeavors.
Running the Model

Our folder is made of eight files grouped in three categories. One file is the main code named as SIMPA_Jean_ICTAS.ipynb, another file for the spatial rich models named as SRM.npy, and six files for the datasets (X_training.npy, y_training.npy, X_testing.npy, y_testing.npy, X_validating.npy, y_validating.npy). 

To run this model, follow these steps: 

1.	Load all the eight files in the same folder.
2.	Create the necessary folders for the trained models and results. 
3.	To run the CNN, you need to have Python with MatplotLib, TensorFlow, Numpy, and OpenCV2 libraries.

Thank you for considering our code and giving suggestions on how to make it more user-friendly!
